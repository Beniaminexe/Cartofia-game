# üïπÔ∏è Cartofia

**Cartofia** is a retro-inspired 2D platformer built with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).  
Run, jump, and collect coins across multiple levels while dodging enemies and hazards.  
Originally inspired by [russs123‚Äôs Platformer project](https://github.com/russs123/Platformer),  
Cartofia expands and refines that foundation with fullscreen support, sound polish, and a new visual style.

## üéÆ Features

- Smooth fullscreen or windowed gameplay.  
- Animated player movement and gravity physics.  
- Moving platforms, enemies, lava, and collectible coins.  
- Level loading from external data files (`pickle`).  
- Background music and sound effects.  
- Simple main menu with Start / Exit buttons.  
- Restart functionality and multi-level progression.

## üß± Level Data

Levels are stored as binary files named `levelX_data` (where X is the level number).
Each contains tile data serialized via Python‚Äôs `pickle` module.
You can edit or replace them to create custom levels.

---

## üé® Assets

All visual and audio assets are located in the `img/` directory:

* `sky.png`, `sun.png` ‚Äì background art
* `dirt.png`, `grass.png` ‚Äì terrain tiles
* `coin.png`, `blob.png`, `lava.png` ‚Äì interactable entities
* `platform.png`, `exit.png` ‚Äì game mechanics
* `music.mp3`, `coin.wav`, `jump.wav`, `game_over.wav` ‚Äì sound and music

## üß† Developer Notes

Cartofia‚Äôs code demonstrates:

* Sprite-based animation
* Collision detection
* Platform physics
* Game loop architecture
* Dynamic scaling for fullscreen rendering

The game runs internally on a **1000√ó1000 virtual canvas**,
which is scaled to your screen resolution for consistent physics and visuals.

---

## üß© Roadmap

* [ ] Add settings menu (volume, difficulty, resolution)
* [ ] Add level selector
* [ ] Save high scores
* [ ] Implement parallax scrolling backgrounds
* [ ] Package via PyInstaller for distribution
